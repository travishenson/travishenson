## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Travis Henson, a JavaScript developer currently based in Fairbanks, Alaska. I'm seeking full-time employment, either remotely (preferred) or locally, but I'm also interested in any project-based or freelance projects, so feel free to contact me with any opportunity.
## Check out [my website](https://travishenson.com) for more information.

### I'm in the process of cleaning up and refreshing my projects and profiles, so things may look a little dusty at this time.
